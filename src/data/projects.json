Using data scraping, statistical analysis, and visualizations, the project explores common traits among the top players, changes in shot locations, and shifts in player stats over time. Key findings include an increase in 3-point shooting, improved player accuracy, and well-rounded performance across points, assists, and rebounds.",

The program continuously generates a terrain grid by mapping noise values to elevation heights, allowing for smooth and natural variations in the terrain. As the simulation progresses, the terrain appears to fly forward, providing a sense of movement and depth. The visualization uses 3D rendering techniques, including rotation and translation, to give the user an immersive view of the generated landscape.",
